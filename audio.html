	<h2 class="audioHeadline">Here is some of my audio work.</h2>
	<p class="audioSubhead">I work for WKAR, the NPR station at Michigan State University. I started working as the All Things Considered intern fall of my freshman year in college. During my time, I've created features that have played on Morning Edition and All Things Considered. I've also produced episodes of Serving Up Science, a WKAR podcast about everything food. I also voice the weather. Previously, it was for Weekend Edition, but now it's for overnights and All Things Considered.</p>

		<section class="RoundaboutText">These features are from an award winning WKAR series called Roundabout. At the Michigan Association of Broadcasters in 2020, Roundabout won first place in the Daily Newscast/News Feature category, and it won honorable mention in the current events program category. WKAR's Abigail Censky, Maxim Jenkins and I created six features informing Lansing and East Lansing residents about the views of their respective city council candidates before the 2019 election. The topics discussed for the Lansing city council candidates are legacy costs, marijuana's impact on the city and bringing businesses and people to the Lansing-area. These are the features I voiced.</section>
